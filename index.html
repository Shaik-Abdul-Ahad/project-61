        <p>My hobby is playing cricket. It makes me feel fresh and energetic.
            I play it daily after school, with my friends in the playground, behind my house.
            Playing outdoor games makes us physically fit. It also boosts the concentration of the mind.
            Activities like bowling, running between the wickets, wicket-keeping, batting and fielding require a lot of physical movement.
            I have made so many friends while playing cricket. Cricket encourages teamwork.
            I think cricket is much better than sitting hours in front of the computer screen or playing video games.
            When I study after playing, I am able to concentrate better and grasp concepts faster.
            My passion for playing cricket has also won me the captaincy in my school cricket team.
            My family motivates me to play well and study hard. I even got my own cricket kit as a birthday present, the previous year.</p>
